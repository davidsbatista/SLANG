# SLANG	Sequence LAbeliNG

Implementation in Keras of some papers for sequence labelling tasks such as Named-Entity Recognition or Part-of-Speech tagging. Currently implementing the following papers:


- ["Neural Architectures for Named Entity Recognition" (Lample et al. 2016)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N16-1030) 

- ["End-to-end Sequence Labeling via Bi-directional LSTM-CNNs-CRF" (Ma und Havoy 2016)](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P16-1101)

This is code that I hope to continue improving, there are still a few TODOs.
